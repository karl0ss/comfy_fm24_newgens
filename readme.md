-   "There are 10000s of faces out there already"
-   "There are tools that work the same already?"  
-   "Have you got nothing better to do with your time?"

These are some of the questions I think you are going to ask me, but I present to you somehting I have been working on,  **Comfy FM24 NewGens**
# The Idea
Taking some inspiration from  [fm-ai-face-generator](https://github.com/emilmirzayev/fm-ai-face-generator), but not wanting to pay for a hosted service (I already have AI  _stuff_  setup on my home server) I started to rewrite chunks to make compatible with a hosted Comfy UI instance, after awhile, I had rewritten so much, that this is now a new beast in itself..

Also taking inspiration from  [NewGAN-Manager](https://github.com/franl08/NewGAN-Manager)  and reworking some of thier code for my uses.

Thanks to both!

So what does this do? Why would you want to use it? (you probably wont but personally, I like a bit more personallisation from my NewGens, some, I get quite attached to :) )

 -   This will create images for your NewGens, based off of information provided from the FM database, making a players image more unique to that player
    
 -   download the images to the specified output directory, all processed players image will be saved as their  **uid**  from the game
    
 -   remove all the background from the generated faces
    
 -   create the needed config file for FM to load the faces,
    
 -   you can then rename the generated folder and place it in your  **graphics**  folder as you would noramlly and voila!
